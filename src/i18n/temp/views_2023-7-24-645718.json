		"views.Irina.645625-0": "Irina是一个网络安全领域的靶场，它同时支持学习、训练、考试、竞赛等多种模式，并且，你可以在Irina上创建自己的内部题库，举办内部比赛，CTF/AWD/PTE都是Irina的强项。",
		"views.Irina.645625-1": "关于Irina",
		"views.Irina.645625-2": "网络安全靶场的建设要满足网络空间安全技能训练需求，通过柔性的复杂网络环境仿真技术，高逼真度地仿真分级分域的具有多个子网的网络环境，支持在仿真的网络环境上安全防护策略的配置与部署。满足目标人员进行网安技能训练、网安作战场景演练和网安仿真场景设计和作战场景的可视化展示。",
		"views.Irina.645625-3": "Irina可以支撑多种多样的比赛，其中包括CTF/AWD/PTE等，同时，Irina还支持多种模式，包括学习、训练、考试、竞赛等。面向高校、企业、政府等机构，提供多种多样的网络安全技能训练场景。",
		"views.Irina.645625-4": "你可以直接选择查看Irina的白皮书：",
		"views.Irina.645625-5": "下载",
		"views.Irina.645625-6": "或者可以查看Irina的在线实例：",
		"views.Irina.645625-7": "一些简单的截图",
		"views.Irina.645625-8": "常规的CTF竞赛，我们支持常见的几乎所有题型，动态扩容的靶机集群，完全自研的分布式架构系统，可以几乎应对所有的场景。",
		"views.Irina.645625-9": "除了CTF竞赛，我们还支持AWD竞赛，AWD竞赛是一种更加真实的网络攻防竞赛，它需要参赛队伍在一个真实的网络环境中进行攻防，进攻的同时防守自己的GameBox，最终获得比赛的胜利。",
		"views.Irina.645625-10": "对于教学，我们也提供了丰富的功能，包括自动批改、自动评分、自动排名等等，可以极大的减轻教师的负担，让教师可以更加专注于教学本身，同时，教师也可以自己创建题目，创建比赛，创建题库，创建学生，创建班级等等。",
		"views.Irina.645625-11": "我们的另一个强项，就是PTE竞赛，我们支持一个最多16层内网32台主机的虚拟环境模拟，同时拥有多个动态的Flag，营造一个更加逼真的内网环境"

		"views.Irina.645625-0": "Irina is a network security target field. It supports learning, training, examination, competition and other modes. You can also create your own internal library on Irina, hold internal competitions, and CTF/AWD/PTE are all Irina's strengths.",
		"views.Irina.645625-1": "About Irina",
		"views.Irina.645625-2": "Network security target field construction should meet the needs of network security skills training. Through flexible and complex network environment simulation technology, it can simulate the network environment with multiple subnets in a hierarchical and subdomain manner, and support the configuration and deployment of security protection strategies on the simulated network environment. Meet the needs of target personnel for network security skills training, network security combat scenario exercises, network security simulation scenario design and combat scenario visualization.",
		"views.Irina.645625-3": "Irina supports a variety of competitions, including CTF/AWD/PTE, etc. At the same time, Irina also supports a variety of modes, including learning, training, examination, competition, etc. It provides a variety of network security skills training scenarios for universities, enterprises, governments and other institutions.",
		"views.Irina.645625-4": "You can directly choose to look up Irina's white paper:",
		"views.Irina.645625-5": "Download",
		"views.Irina.645625-6": "Or you can access Irina's online instance:",
		"views.Irina.645625-7": "Some simple screenshots",
		"views.Irina.645625-8": "Rugular CTF competition, we support almost all common types of questions, dynamically scalable target machine cluster, completely self-developed distributed architecture system, which can deal with almost all scenarios.",
		"views.Irina.645625-9": "Not only CTF competitions, but also do we support AWD competitions. AWD competitions are a more realistic network attack and defense competition. Participating teams need to attack and defend their own GameBox in a real network environment. Finally, they win the competition.",
		"views.Irina.645625-10": "For teaching, we also provide rich functions, including automatic marking, automatic scoring, automatic ranking and so on, which can greatly reduce the burden of teachers, so that teachers can focus more on teaching itself. At the same time, teachers can also create questions, competitions, question banks, students, classes and so on.",
		"views.Irina.645625-11": "Our another strength is PTE competition. We support a virtual environment simulation with up to 16 layers of intranet and 32 hosts, as well as multiple dynamic flags to create a more realistic intranet environment."
